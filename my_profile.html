                        <h5>My take on β-Glucans and its sources.</h5>
                        <p>It started when I was struggling to fight fatigue. 
                            Tremendous stress and lack of rest at a previous employment resulted in problems with blood pressure and chronic fatigue.
                            After trying all means without success, a friend recommended that I take <span class="species-name">Phellinus linteus</span> extract. </p>
                          <p> As a biologist by training, and done having 10 years of research in life science, I have researched thoroughly on this medicinal mushroom and came to know of the substance named β-Glucan.
                            Further research indicated that this substance have published evidences of strengthening the immune system, help fight against cancer and ease symptons of diatetes. 
                            Many other mushroom and some plant produce also contain β-Glucan of various amount. </p>
                          <p> My aims 
                          <ul>
                              <li>to share the knowledge I have gathered over years on β-Glucan from the viewpoint of a trained biologist.</li>
                              <li>to educate my readers on how to verify information optained from the internet, especially on health supplements.
                                  In the digital age today, the internet is filled with tremendous amount of information, much of which are but myth or unfounded believe.
                                  Therefore it is important to know the how and where to acquire reliable knowledge.</li>
                            
                        </ul> 
                          <p>To good health! </p>
